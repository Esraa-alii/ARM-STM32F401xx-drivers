# STM32F401xx Driver Implementation
This repository contains an implementation of the STM32F401xx ARM microcontroller driver. The driver provides an interface for accessing the hardware peripherals of the microcontroller.

##  Quick review 
The STM32F401xx devices are based on the high-performance
ARM® Cortex® -M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 84 MHz.

## Getting Started
To get started with using the driver in your project, you will need to have the following :

- Your preferred ARM development environment (e.g. Eclipse,Keil, IAR, GCC)
- STM32F401xx board 

## Installing the Driver
To install the driver in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Add the files to your project in your preferred development environment.
3. Configure your development environment to use the STM32F401xx 
as the target microcontroller.
4. Build the project to ensure that the driver is properly integrated.

## Using the Driver
To use the driver in your code, include the relevant header files and call the driver functions as needed. Refer to the documentation in the header files for more information on the available functions.

## Contributing
If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue in the repository. Pull requests are also welcome.
